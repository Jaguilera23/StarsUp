# CryptoExchange MultiPage

This is the final project I completed for the frontend course at [CoderHouse](https://www.coderhouse.es/?utm_term=coderhouse&utm_campaign=0&utm_source=google_search_brand&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8qmhBhClARIsANAtbofTiZZCHzIytoPyUPvCFmzL2ODsF1gAwTUmOu1itlChMJlrZy3MPzIaAhnTEALw_wcB). t is a multi-page web page for a crypto exchange, which includes a dashboard and a brandbook. So far, the project has only been designed, but you can appreciate the structure and visual design that has been planned for the platform.

## Features

This project simulates a crypto exchange site that allows users to perform cryptocurrency exchanges. It has been created with a multi-page structure that allows navigation through different sections of the platform, including a dashboard with information about transactions and account balance.<br> <br> Additionally, a brandbook has been created that defines the colors, typographies, and visual elements that will be used on the platform, with the aim of maintaining a consistent and recognizable visual identity.

## Technologies

To develop this project, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used, as well as Sass and Bootstrap to enhance the efficiency of the development process. Sass allowed for more efficient and modular styling, while Bootstrap facilitated the creation of a responsive and high-quality design.
